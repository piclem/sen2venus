# sen2venus
Unofficial dataloader for the [Sen2VenÂµs dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/6514159).

## Overview

(wip)

## Features

- **Automatic download from zenodo**: The Zenodo URLs and hashes are included. From a region name ([see the list](https://zenodo.org/record/6514159)), the corresponding subset is downloaded and decompressed. 

- **x2 or x4 dataset loading**: you can pick the `rgbnir` or the `rededge` subset to load the x2 or the x4 low and high resolution patches.

- **inspired from existing frameworks**: the Sen2Venus class is inspired from [the torchsr dataset definition style](https://github.com/Coloquinte/torchSR/tree/main/torchsr/datasets) and the torchvision download utility are used.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install sen2venus
